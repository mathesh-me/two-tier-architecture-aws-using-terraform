## Step 2 : Installing necessary Plugins

We have to ensure the necessary Terraform plugins installations. You have to create a new file with .tf extension and copy the code from [provider.tf](https://github.com/mathesh-me/two-tier-architecture-aws-using-terraform/blob/main/Two%20tier%20architecture%20in%20AWS%20using%20terraform/provider.tf) in my repository and paste it in here. Then run the below command for plugins installation
```
terraform init
```
The above command will install the necessary plugins required.
